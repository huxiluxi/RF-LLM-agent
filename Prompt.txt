I want to design a rectangular patch antenna with microstrip feed.

It should operate at 2.4 GHz.
Be matched to 50 Ohm.
The feed gap should be 1 mm.
I want to use FR4 with er=4.3, h=1.5mm, tand=0.025.
You compute the dimensions and feeding geometry using these informations.
I want the simulation from 2 to 3 GHz.
